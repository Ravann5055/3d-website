### 🧪 How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/miladicode.git
   cd miladicode
   ```

2. **Open `index.html` in a browser**

   * Replace dummy text, contact email, and Spline models with your own.
   * Update `EmailJS` credentials in `app.js`.

### 🚀 How to Deploy on GitHub Pages

> ✅ Make sure your project is in a GitHub repository (e.g., `miladicode`).

1. **Push your code to GitHub**
2. Go to **Settings → Pages**
3. Under **Source**, select `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder
4. Click **Save** — your site will be live at:
   `https://yourusername.github.io/miladicode/`

📌 *Note:* Ensure all assets (images/videos/scripts) use **relative paths**, not absolute or local file paths.

---

### 💡 Customization Ideas

* Add a blog section using markdown or static content.
* Integrate a CMS (e.g., Contentful or Netlify CMS) if needed.
* Replace AOS.js with custom GSAP animations for more control.
* Enhance accessibility and SEO for production readiness.
